## Short Description
The model describes a job application process, starting with posting an open position and completing with receiving the signed contract.
A job posting is created, published, and eventually unpublished.
Once the posting is open, multiple applications can be received and checked.
Applications that have been checked can be reviewed and applicants can be invited for interviews.
Once an interview has been accepted it will be conducted, and meanwhile a protocol is created.
It is still possible to review the application.
Considering all protocols and reviews for one application, the applicant can be accepted or rejected.
If an applicant was accepted, they can reject the offer or sign the contract.
If they do neither and miss the deadline, they will be rejected.
