# Paper Submission and Reviewing

## Short Description
This case model covers paper submission and reviewing at an academic conference.
It starts when the conference has been scheduled and ends once all authors have been notified.
The call for papers (CfP) is published and sent, before the submission is openend.
Then, authors can submit papers.
If neccessary, the submission deadline can be extended, which is followed by informing authors and program commitee.
Eventually, the submission is closed and reviewers are assigned to papers.
The reviews are created, and eventually a decision is made.
The paper is accepted or rejected and the author is informed.
