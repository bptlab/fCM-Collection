## Description

The process begins when a patient who potentially has diabetes arrives.
The physician starts with an anamneses.
To make an initial diagnosis, the physician may run
- a fasting plasma glucose test
- a casual plasma glucose test
- a glucose tolerance test
- and a HbA1c blood test
At least three tests need to be conducted.
At least two of three test results must indicate diabetes to diagnose diabetes.
The glucose tolerance test consists of three steps: glucose is administered and the plasma glucose levels are measured after 1h and after 2h.
The HbA1c test is a lab test.
While the diagnosis is running, the physician may read the doctor's note, if it exists.
Once the initial testing has been performed, an inital diagnosis is made: the patient may have diabetes or not.
If the patient does not have diabetes, he or she is released with a doctor's note.
Otherwise, the diagnosis needs to be refined.
Therefore, additional test may be conducted, such as an antibody test or a lab test.
Given the refined diagnosis, treatment can start.
It usually consist of
- a consultation session on how to change the patient's life style to the better
- and a prescription
Furthermore, an appointment for training sessions can be made.
