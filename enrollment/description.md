## Description

The process describes the enrollment for students in a study program.
A student is invited and admissioned.
Subsequently, the student either has to take an entrace exam or request that a prior exam is verified.
Students that have taken an entry exam will be ranked into two categories (B and S).
Students can either enroll in the program using self-financing, which requires them tu pay insurance and tuition or in a budget program (only insurance needs to be paid, only possible for S ranked students).
Afterwards, the student is registered and an index is issued.
