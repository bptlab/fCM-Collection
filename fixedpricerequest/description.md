## Description

First, a fixed price request is drafted.
Next, it needs to be verified.
Therefore, it legally reviewed followed by a general review.
Afterwards, the request is either valid or rejected.
A rejected request can be revised and verified again, or it can be abandoned.
Once a request is valid, it can be send.
Subsequently, supplers respond to the request.
For each response, one requester evaluation, one buyer evaluation, and multiple reviewes are created.
Given this information, the response is either rejected or selected as a winner.
Once a winner has been chosen, the process is complete.
During the whole process, the request can be canceled.
