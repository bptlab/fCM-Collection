# Press Process

## Description
The process describes the operations of central press agency.
It starts when the agency hears about some news, which are first considered to be rumors.
Afterwards, an inital assessment follows. It may result in uncoverying the news as fake.
If the news appear to be legible, their relevance is considered.

For lebible news, evidence is considered.
Therefore, social media is researched, statements from involved parties may be requested, interviews may be conducted, and a photographer may be comissioned.
All these items are assessed: are they relevant?
Given the all relevant items, the news are eventually reassessed.
Reassessment may confirm the news, say there are evidence, or keep them in state possible.

The process may still continue as subject/situation may continue to develop, i.e., new information, evidence, and co may arise.
The knowledge workers can close the case at any point.
