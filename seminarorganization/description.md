## Short Description
This model descriptions the organization of a research oriented master seminar.
First, a theme is selected and a staff member is chosen to organize the seminar.
Afterwards, the requirements are specified before the staff is asked to provide topics.
Now, PhD students can propose topics by
1. Filling a form
2. Proposing the topic
3. And discussing the topic with the supervisor. There are two possible outcomes, a topic may be selected or rejected.
Multiple topics can be proposed concurrently.
After the topic deadline, a seminar description is created based on the selected topics.
